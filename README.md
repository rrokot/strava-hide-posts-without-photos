## Features

- **Photo filter** — hides all posts without photos (camera icon 📷)
- **Virtual filter** — hides virtual activities like Zwift, indoor rides, etc. (monitor icon 🖥️)
- Both filters work **independently** — enable one, both, or none
- **Hidden posts counter** — each button shows a red badge with the number of hidden posts
- **Persistent state** — remembers your filter settings after page reloads
- **Performance optimized** — debounced DOM observation that reacts only to feed-related changes
- Works with **infinite scroll** and dynamically loaded feed items

## How it works

Two filter buttons appear next to the feed filter dropdown (e.g., "Following" / "All"):

| Button | Function | Default |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 📷 Camera | Hide posts without photos | **ON** |
| 🖥️ Monitor | Hide virtual activities | **OFF** |

Button colors indicate the state:
- **Orange** (`#fc5200`) — filter is active
- **Gray** (`#888`) — filter is disabled

Each active filter shows a **red badge** with the count of hidden posts.
